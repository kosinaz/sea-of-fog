Hours have passed since the battle's end. I've wandered aimlessly, calling out for my squad, but all I hear is silence. Unable to scale the treacherous mountainsides, I'm left with no choice but to delve deeper into this Sea of Fog.
A tunnel? It's ancient, but... perhaps it's a path to escape.
As I step into the dimly lit chamber, a cracked mirror catches my eye. A pile of rubble occupies one corner, two weathered barrels rest in another, and near the entrance, a rusted iron grate lies embedded in the floor.
Among the debris, I uncover a hidden lever. As I pull it, a distant rumble echoes through the chamber.
The distorted images staring back at me offer no answers.
The barrels sit empty. Their contents are long decayed.
Despite my efforts, I find no means to open the iron grate.
In the fog-shrouded courtyard, an ancient statue loom ominously. A weathered fountain stands in the center, while along one wall, a mural tells the tales of a forgotten civilization.
In the fountain, atop the central pedestal, I find a loose crystal orb. I decide to take it with me.
The statue, though imposing, offers no clues for my journey.
The faded mural yields no answers, its meaning lost to time.
After countless trials, I stumble upon a stairway. Without hesitation, I ascend, hoping to finally reach the mountain's summit. And then, as I gaze down into the depths of the valley, the undeniable truth reveals itself... This world is not the one I left behind. It's a different one, shrouded in truly endless fog and crowned with alien mountains. Yet, instead of despair, a sense of contentment washes over me. Accepting my fate, I release the futile pursuit of my past. Once more, I choose to press forward, delving deeper into the unknown, eager to uncover its mysteries and shape my own destiny. For I am, and always will be, a wanderer above the sea of fog...
